Files in this study are based on Joshua Lin's work classifying hbb from QCD backgrounds.

The original work (https://github.com/springbottom/hbb_study_code) is contained in /josh-legacy, where /josh-legacy/pythia_code contains c++ pre-selection and showering code and binaries implemented with pythia and fastjet, and /josh_legacy/hbb_study.ipynb contains CNN analysis based on python2.7, tensorflow 1.8.0 and keras 2.1.6. The showering program produces .csv format as explained in the new, hbb_background_classifier.ipynb analysis in the root folder.

hbb-background-classifier is a modified version of Joshua Lin's code implemented with keras 2.3.1 (newest version supporting by squirrel GPU driver) and tensorflow 2.0. 

Jan 8th: Analysis and SIC metrics implementations are finished, but hyperparameters are not tuned. Utilities plotting jet images and diagrams are implemented but not yet organized. Model names are also confusing and need refactoring.
